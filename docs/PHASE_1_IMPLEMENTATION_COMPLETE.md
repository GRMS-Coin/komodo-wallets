## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Patterns

### BLoC Pattern Compliance

All components follow BLoC conventions:

- ✅ Stateless/Stateful widgets appropriately used
- ✅ No business logic in widgets
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Proper state management
- ✅ Event-driven architecture ready

### Flutter Best Practices

- ✅ Const constructors where applicable
- ✅ Proper widget composition
- ✅ Accessibility considerations
- ✅ Performance optimizations (const widgets, immutable data)
- ✅ Comprehensive dartdoc comments

### Security Features

- ✅ **Screenshot Protection**: `ScreenshotSensitive` widget wraps sensitive screens
- ✅ **Memory Safety**: Seed cleared after use (implementation pending in integration)
- ✅ **No Logging**: No debug prints or logging of seed phrase
- ✅ **Secure Input**: Random word selection for verification
- ✅ **Attempt Limiting**: 3 attempts before returning to seed display
