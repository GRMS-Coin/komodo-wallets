## 🔄 Complete Onboarding State Machine

### New Wallet Creation States

```dart
enum WalletCreationStep {
  initial,              // Show wallet creation form
  createPasscode,       // Phase 2: Enter 6-digit passcode
  confirmPasscode,      // Phase 2: Confirm passcode
  seedBackupWarning,    // Phase 1: Educational warning
  seedDisplay,          // Phase 1: Show 12-word seed
  seedConfirmation,     // Phase 1: Quiz verification
  biometricSetup,       // Phase 2: Optional Face ID/Touch ID
  walletReady,          // Phase 2: Success screen
  complete,             // Login and enter wallet
}
```

### State Transitions

```
initial → (Wallet form submitted) → createPasscode (if enabled)
createPasscode → confirmPasscode
confirmPasscode → initial (back to form to finish)
[Wallet created by AuthBloc]
initial → seedBackupWarning
seedBackupWarning → seedDisplay
seedDisplay → seedConfirmation
seedConfirmation → biometricSetup
biometricSetup → walletReady
walletReady → complete → [Login]
```

## 🎬 How to Test

### Quick Test Script

```bash
# 1. Clear app data (simulate first launch)
flutter clean

# 2. Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# 3. Run app
flutter run -d chrome

# 4. Test Flow:
#    - Should see start screen
#    - Click "Create new wallet"
#    - Select Iguana wallet type
#    - (Optional: Enter passcode - currently optional)
#    - Fill wallet form
#    - See seed backup warning
#    - View seed phrase
#    - Complete seed quiz
#    - (Optional: Setup biometric - currently optional)
#    - See success screen
#    - Enter wallet
#    - Verify hasBackup = true
```

### Verification Points

1. **Start Screen Shows**: Only on first launch
2. **Passcode Optional**: Can be skipped (for now)
3. **Seed Backup Mandatory**: Cannot proceed without completing
4. **Seed Quiz Works**: Correctly validates 4 random words
5. **Biometric Optional**: Can be skipped
6. **Success Screen Shows**: Before entering wallet
7. **Banner Shows**: Only if `!hasBackup` (test with old wallet)
8. **Analytics Events**: Check console logs for events

---

## 💡 Key Implementation Decisions

### 1. Passcode Made Optional

**Decision**: Passcode flow exists but is not mandatory  
**Reason**: Allow gradual rollout, existing users not forced  
**Future**: Can be made mandatory via config flag

### 2. Onboarding in WalletsManagerWrapper

**Decision**: First-launch detection in wrapper, not main app  
**Reason**: Keeps onboarding scoped to wallet management  
**Benefit**: Easier to test and maintain

### 3. Biometric After Seed Backup

**Decision**: Biometric setup comes after seed confirmation  
**Reason**: Seed backup is critical, biometric is convenience  
**UX**: Natural flow from security → convenience

### 4. Banner Navigation to Settings Section

**Decision**: Navigate to Settings > Security, not specific screen  
**Reason**: Simpler implementation, user can find seed settings  
**Future**: Can add direct navigation to seed backup screen

### 5. State Machine in IguanaWalletsManager

**Decision**: Single state machine for entire create flow  
**Reason**: Centralized control, easier to debug  
**Benefit**: Clear flow visualization

## 📞 Support Information

### Common User Questions

**Q: Why do I need to backup my seed now?**  
A: We've improved security to ensure you never lose access to your funds. The seed backup is now mandatory during wallet creation.

**Q: What's the passcode for?**  
A: The passcode provides quick access to your wallet without entering your full password every time.

**Q: Can I skip biometric setup?**  
A: Yes! Biometric authentication is optional. You can always use your passcode instead.

**Q: I forgot my passcode, what do I do?**  
A: You can reset your passcode by logging in with your wallet password.

**Q: The backup banner won't go away!**  
A: Please complete the seed backup in Settings > Security > Seed Settings.
